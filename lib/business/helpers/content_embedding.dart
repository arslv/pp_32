            '''Nutrients play a key role in maintaining the proper functioning of the body. They provide the body with essential nutrients that help maintain health and energy.
Firstly, proteins are the main building material of the body. They are involved in the formation and repair of tissues such as muscles, bones and organs. Proteins also play an important role in the synthesis of enzymes, hormones and antibodies, which help maintain the normal functioning of organs and systems.
Secondly, carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body. They are broken down into glucose, which is used by cells to produce ATP, the main source of energy. Carbohydrates also contain fiber, which helps maintain normal digestive system function and prevent constipation.
Thirdly, fats are an important component of nutrition. They are a source of energy and also help absorb certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, K). Fats are also necessary for the formation of cell membranes and the synthesis of hormones. However, it is important to choose healthy fats, such as unsaturated fats found in fish, nuts and vegetable oils, and avoid saturated and trans fats.
Fourthly, vitamins and minerals play an important role in maintaining the normal functioning of organs and systems. Vitamins are involved in metabolic processes, the immune system and protection against free radicals. Minerals such as calcium, iron and zinc are essential for healthy bones, blood and immune system.
In general, nutrients are an integral part of the proper functioning of the body. They provide energy, building blocks and essential elements to maintain health and vitality. Therefore, it is important to monitor your diet and include a variety of nutritious foods to ensure that your body has everything it needs to function optimally.

        text:
            '''Excessive consumption of sugar and salt is one of the main causes of many diseases and health problems. Constantly consuming large amounts of sugar and salt can have serious harmful effects on the body.
Excess sugar consumption can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Sugar contains empty calories that contain no beneficial nutrients but provide a large amount of energy to the body. This can lead to the accumulation of excess weight and the development of obesity. In addition, excess sugar consumption can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, which can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. High blood sugar can also damage artery walls and contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.
Excessive salt intake can lead to hypertension, heart failure and kidney disease. Salt contains sodium, which is the main component of salt. Excess sodium intake can cause the body to retain water, which increases blood volume and strains the heart. This can lead to the development of hypertension and heart failure. In addition, excess salt intake can damage the kidneys and increase the risk of developing kidney disease.
To prevent the harmful effects of excess sugar and salt consumption, it is necessary to maintain moderation in your consumption. It is recommended to limit your intake of added sugars such as sugar, syrups and sweets. Instead, it is recommended to consume natural sweets such as fruits. Regarding salt, it is recommended to limit your consumption of table salt and prefer cooking without adding salt. It is also recommended to increase your consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits, which contain natural minerals and vitamins.
Overall, excess sugar and salt intake can have serious harmful effects on the body. It can lead to the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other diseases. It is therefore advisable to maintain moderation in your sugar and salt intake and opt for healthier alternatives such as fresh vegetables and fruits.

It is important to consider your preferences and restrictions: if you prefer certain foods or suffer from allergies, this should also be taken into account when creating a meal plan. The next step is to develop a balanced plan that includes a variety of foods that meet the body's protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamin and mineral needs.
Meal frequency and portion size must also be taken into account. Regular meals help maintain your metabolism and energy levels. Finally, it is important to monitor your body's response to your new eating plan and make adjustments as needed.
Creating a nutrition plan that suits your needs and goals requires careful consideration, but if done correctly, will help you achieve your desired results and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
